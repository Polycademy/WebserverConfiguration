WebserverConfiguration
======================

Web server configuration for Apache (via .htaccess) and NGINX.

Apache's .htaccess is a bit more flexible, however it is not as high performance as NGINX as Apache needs to read each .htaccess file.

NGINX also has the advantage of a much more elegant syntax, making it actually far easier to learn how to use.

These configuration files are based off the H5BP project, however they have been enhanced to be a bit more opinionated for Polycademy's usage.
